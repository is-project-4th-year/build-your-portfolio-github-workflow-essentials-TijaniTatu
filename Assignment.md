## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

- **Branching**: Allowed me to develop each feature independently and avoid affecting the main codebase. Each feature or fix lived in its own branch until it was ready to merge.

- **Commit Conventions**: Using structured commit messages helped keep my history organized and readable. For example, I used `feat`, `fix`, `style`, `chore`, etc., based on the type of change.

- **Pull Requests**: Helped me track each feature and link it back to an issue. Also let me test changes before merging into the main code.

- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: I simulated and resolved a conflict between two branches that modified the same part of the footer ‚Äî learning how to manually merge code.

## 5. Commit Convention Samples

Here are six different commit types I used:

- `feat(portfolio): add layout for landing page`
- `style(contact): apply background and spacing to contact section`
- `fix(conflict): resolve merge conflict in footer`
- `docs(readme): add deployed link to Assignment.md`
- `refactor(projects): simplify project card structure`
- `chore(gitignore): ignore backup and build files`
